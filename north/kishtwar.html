                <p> Kishtwar Himalaya is described as a small sub range of the Himalaya Mountains, in the states of
                    Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The Kishtwar Himalayan range is of sharp rocks and ice
                    peaks. The reason behind this is that its highest peak, Bharanzar (Sickle Moon) is only 6,574
                    metres in altitude. Nestling on the northeast bank of the Chenab River between Kashmir to the north
                    and Chamba Lahul to the south, Kishtwar Himalayan range is defined as mountaineer's playground.
                    The first mountaineers to visit Kishtwar were three Austrians who, after making the first ascent of
                    Mulkila in Lahul in the year 1939, were interned in India at the outbreak of war. Again eight years
                    later in 1947, at the same time while waiting for their passages back home, Fritz Kolb, with his
                    friends Ludwig Krenek and Fabian Geduldig, visited the Kishtwar range. From a base at Machail they
                    explored the eastern approaches to 'Sickle Moon', the highest peak in the range. They also climbed
                    two small peaks. However, their first attempt to cross the main Himalayan watershed failed. They
                    continued up the Dharlang nala and crossed the remote Poat la into Zanskar, and returned to the
                    Kishtwar side over the Umasi la.</p>
