            <h1>K2</h1>
            The Earth’s second highest mountain, after Mount Everest, is K2, also known as Mount Godwin Austen and as
            Dapsang. The peak, 28,238 feet (8,607 meters) high, is in the Karakoram Range of northern Jammu and Kashmir,
            near the border of Pakistan and China. It was given the name K2 because it was the second peak measured in
            this range. It was also named Godwin Austen for the peak’s first surveyor, H.H. Godwin Austen, a
            19th-century English geographer.<br>

            K2 was long considered unclimbable because of its great height, almost unbroken slopes of rock and ice, and
            precipitous overhangs. The first of several unsuccessful attempts to reach K2’s summit was made in 1902.
            Finally, in 1954 an Italian expedition, led by Ardito Desio, succeeded. Achille Compagnoni and Lino
            Lacedelli, the team chosen from this expedition to attempt the final portion of the climb, are credited with
            having reached the summit.<br>
