                <p> Garhwal Himalaya forms the center part of the Himalaya Mountains. Garhwal is considered as the land
                    of several forts. Garhwal Himalayas symbolizes a spiritual truth beyond the general principles of
                    the common man. This quality has attracted sages and pilgrims for limitless centuries. Central
                    Garhwal consists of the mountain area around the Saraswati-Alaknanda river system and the Dhauli
                    valley. The Dhauli after joining up with the Rishi Ganga eventually joins the Alaknanda at Joshimath. The region is of some considerable
                    significance in Hindu mythology, and Badrinath on the Alaknanda is one of the four holy places of
                    pilgrimage - the others being Kedarnath, Jamnotri and Gangotrii. The exploration and mapping of this
                    region started, as usual, with the survey parties from the Survey of India.

                    Garhwal is the birthplace of two most holy rivers of Hinduism - Ganga River and the Yamuna River.
                    Moreover, this is the place of the char dhams, which means the four Himalayan shrines that have
                    attracted Hindu pilgrims for centuries. There are several great peaks that rise majestically at the
                    Garhwal Himalaya region like the Kamet, Nanda Devi and Trishul. They are separated by the rivers of
                    northern India. </p>
