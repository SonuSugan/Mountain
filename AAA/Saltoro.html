        <p>The Saltoro Mountains are a subrange of the Karakoram Range. They are located in the heart of the Karakoram, 
            on the southwest side of the Siachen Glacier, one of the two longest glaciers outside of the polar regions. 
            The name given to this range is shared with the Saltoro Valley which is located west of this range on the 
            Pakistan side of the Line of Actual Control. They are claimed as part of Jammu and Kashmir by India and as
            part of Gilgitâ€“Baltistan by Pakistan.
            In 1984, India assumed military control of the main peaks and passes of the range, with Pakistani forces
            pushed into the glacial valleys just to the west. Hence, despite high peaks and dramatic climbing 
            opportunities, are little visited except by military forces due to the ongoing Siachen Conflict. On the 
            southwest side, the Saltoro Mountains drop steeply to the valleys of the Kondus and Dansam Rivers, which 
            join to form the Saltoro River, a tributary of the Shyok River. River. To the northwest, the Kondus Glacier 
            separates the range from the neighboring Masherbrum Mountains, while on the southeast, the Gyong River, 
            Glacier, and Pass (Gyong La) separate the
            northern Saltoro
            Mountains from the southern Saltoro Mountains or "Kailas Mountains" .</p>
