                <p>The Nallamalas (also called the Nallamalla Range) are a section of the Eastern Ghats which forms the
                    eastern boundary of Rayalaseema region of the state of Andhra Pradesh and Nagarkurnool district of
                    the state of Telangana, in India. They run in a nearly north-south alignment, parallel to the
                    Coromandel Coast for close to 430 km between the rivers, Krishna and Pennar. Its northern boundaries
                    are marked by the flat Palnadu basin while in the south it merges with the Tirupati hills. An
                    extremely old system, the hills have extensively weathered and eroded over the years. The average
                    elevation today is about 520 m which reaches 1100 m at Bhairani Konda and 1048 m at Gundla
                    Brahmeswara. Both of these peaks are in a north westerly direction from the town of Cumbum. There
                    are also many other peaks above 800m.</p>
