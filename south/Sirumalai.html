                <p>Sirumalai (Tamil: சிறுமலை) is a region of 60,000 acres (200 km2) situated 25 km (16 mi) from
                    Dindigul, 90 km (56 mi) from Madurai, and 125 km from Trichy, Tamil Nadu, India. There are many high
                    hills in the area. Sirumalai range is the last mountain range of the Eastern Ghats. The
                    last mountains of the Sirumalai mountain range are the Azhagar Kovil Hills which are present in
                    Madurai District. Azhagar Kovil Hills are the most important place of worship for the Hindu
                    religion. Tracking is allowed in the Azhagar Kovil Hills. 
                    Sirumalai is a dense forest region with a moderate climate throughout the year. With an altitude of
                    1600 metres above sea level, it contains diversified flora and fauna. The hill has 18 hairpin bends.
                    On the 18th bend are a church and a viewpoint of Dindigul city and the Dindigul Rock Fort. The famous Sirumalai banana is slowly disappearing from disease,
                    which scientists have been unable to prevent.
                    Man-made fires on the hills have destroyed medicinal plants and threatened the fauna habitat. Fires
                    are often set to promote vegetation growth used for animal fodder, clear land for cultivation, or
                    improve access to timber.</p>
