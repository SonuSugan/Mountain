                <p>Palkonda Hills, series of ranges in southern Andhra Pradesh state, southern India. The hills trend
                    northwest to southeast and form the central part of the Eastern Ghats. Geologically, they are
                    relicts of ancient mountains formed during the Cambrian Period (about 540 to 490 million years ago)
                    that were subsequently eroded by the Penneru River and its tributaries. The Punchu and Cheyyeru
                    rivers join in a spectacular confluence in a gorge in the corridor between the Velikonda Range and
                    the Palkonda Hills. Formed of quartzites, slates, and lavas, the Palkondas reach an elevation of
                    about 3,000 feet (900 metres) in the south. The valleys between the mountains are drained by
                    streams, many of which, having been dammed for water-storage tanks, provide irrigation for
                    cultivation. The main crops are jowar (grain sorghum) and peanuts (groundnuts).

                    The Palkonda range has a southeast to northwest orientation and traverse the districts of Anantapur
                    and Kadapa. These hills average 2,000 ft in elevation. The highest point of the range is at Buttaid
                    where it reaches a height of 3,060 ft. A westward extension of the range in Anantapur forms the
                    Seshachalam Hills.</p>
