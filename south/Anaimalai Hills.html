                <p>The Anamala or Anaimalai, also known as the Elephant Mountains, are a range of mountains in the
                    southern Western Ghats of central Kerala (Idukki district, Ernakulam district, Palakkad district,
                    Thrissur district) and span the border of western Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore district and Tiruppur
                    district) in Southern India. The name anamala is derived from the Malayalam word aana and the Tamil
                    word aanai, meaning elephant, or from tribal languages. Mala or Malai means 'hill', and thus
                    'Elephant hill'.

                    Anamudi Peak (8,842 feet (2,695 metres)) lies at the southern end of the range and is the highest
                    peak in southern India. The Palakkad Gap is the mountain pass which divides it from the Nilgiri
                    Mountains. The northern slopes of the hills in Tamil Nadu now have coffee and tea
                    plantations(especially around Valparai), as well as teak plantations of high economic value. The
                    rest are mostly forests, of mainly two ecoregions-the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests
                    (mainly in Palakkad district and Idukki district of Kerala, as well as Tamil Nadu) and the South
                    Western Ghats montane rain forests(mainly in Idukki district, Ernakulam district, Palakkad district
                    of Kerala, Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu).</p>
