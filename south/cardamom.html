                <p>The Cardamom Hills or Yela Mala are mountain range of southern India and part of the southern Western
                    Ghats located in Idukki district, Kerala, India. Their name comes from the cardamom spice grown in
                    much of the hills' cool elevation, which also supports pepper and coffee. The Western Ghats and
                    Periyar Sub-Cluster including the Cardamom Hills are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

                    The Cardamom Hills central point is about 9°52′N 77°09′E. They cover about 2,800 km2 of mountainous
                    terrain with deep valleys, and includes the drainages of the west flowing Periyar, Mullayar and
                    Pamba rivers. It includes Idukki Dam and Mullaperiyar Dam. They conjoin the Anaimalai Hills to the
                    northwest, the Palani Hills to the northeast and the Pothigai to the south as far as the Aryankavu
                    pass (at c. 9° N). The crest of the hills form the boundary between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Anamudi
                    (8,842 ft (2695 m)) in Eravikulam National Park, is the highest peak in Western ghats and also the
                    highest point in India south of the Himalayas.</p>
